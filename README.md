This is a working example of my IB Computer Science HL Project, where I have made a sample event database for my high school's marching band. 

Here is a video demonstrating my event functionality: [https://youtu.be/t9qkPmO0-To](url)

This demonstrates the functionality of my front-end and back-end applications, in which the user is able to perform basic CRUD functionality after logging into my database. Authenticated users are able to upload, edit, and delete events from the event database after logging in, while users who are just browsing the website are able to search the event database.
